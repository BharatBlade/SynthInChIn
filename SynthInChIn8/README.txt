This code is still being worked on.

It uses OpenBabel, and includes SOME of the files that come in the installation, for the purpose of running my program, which uses their code.

Please do not modify any of the files or filenames

The files you can/should modify are:

reactants.txt, products.txt (only InChIs go here, separate them line by line)

inchi3.csv - modify this carefully if needed. The reaction conditions, reactants, and products inchis are separated by "%" as you can see in the database.

To use the program, make sure you have the latest version of Java and double-click SynthInChIn8.jar
